### ‚úÖ Question 1

In a ride-booking system, we have a `User` class that can be either a **Driver** or a **Passenger**, represented by an `enum` field.

```java
public class User {
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Role role; // DRIVER or PASSENGER

    @OneToMany
    private List<Booking> bookings;
}

public enum Role {
    DRIVER,
    PASSENGER
}
```

The `Booking` class has two `ManyToOne` relationships referencing the `User` class:

```java
public class Booking {
    @ManyToOne
    private User driver;

    @ManyToOne
    private User passenger;
}
```

Now the question is:

> **How can the field `private List<Booking> bookings;` in the `User` class distinguish whether the user is a `driver` or a `passenger` in each booking? Since both relationships refer to the same `User` entity, how does JPA know which side to map?**

---

### ‚úÖ Solution:

JPA does **not** automatically know whether the user is a **driver** or **passenger** unless you explicitly tell it via `mappedBy`.

The `bookings` list in `User` needs to be split into **two separate collections**:

#### ‚úÖ Updated `User` class:

```java
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Role role; // DRIVER or PASSENGER

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "driver")
    private List<Booking> drivingBookings; // bookings where user is the driver

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "passenger")
    private List<Booking> passengerBookings; // bookings where user is the passenger
}
```

#### ‚úÖ `Booking` class:

```java
@Entity
public class Booking {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "driver_id")
    private User driver;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "passenger_id")
    private User passenger;
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* `mappedBy = "driver"` tells JPA to populate `drivingBookings` with all bookings where the user is referenced as the `driver`.
* `mappedBy = "passenger"` does the same for `passengerBookings`.
* This way, the role of the user in a booking is **explicitly distinguished**.

---

### üîç Bonus: When to Use Enum?

The `Role` enum can still be useful for general logic like UI control, access management, or business logic, **but should not be used to determine the relationship mapping**. The mappings should always rely on `mappedBy`.


# ‚úÖ Question
Sure! Understanding **owning side** vs **inverse side** (also called **non-owning** side) is **crucial in JPA** for mapping relationships correctly.

---

### üß† Core Concept:

In JPA **bidirectional relationships**, **one side must be the "owning side"**, and the other side is the **inverse (non-owning) side**.

---

### ‚úÖ Owning Side:
- **Controls the relationship** in the database.
- **Has the foreign key column**.
- **Defines `@JoinColumn`**.
- Any updates to the relationship should be made on the owning side.

### ‚úÖ Inverse Side:
- **Refers back to the owning side** using `mappedBy`.
- **Does not have the foreign key**.
- Used to map the relationship in the object model, not the database.

---

### `mappedBy` is **always used on the **inverse (non-owning)** side of a bidirectional association**, and in JPA, the **inverse side is typically the `One` side** in a `OneToMany` ‚Üî `ManyToOne` relationship.

---

### üîÅ Understanding Ownership

| Annotation | Role | Can `mappedBy` be used here? | Explanation |
|-----------|------|------------------------------|-------------|
| `@ManyToOne` | **Owning side** | ‚ùå **No** | Always the owning side (holds the foreign key) |
| `@OneToMany` | **Inverse side** | ‚úÖ **Yes** | Must use `mappedBy` to point to the owning side |
| `@OneToOne` | Either side | ‚úÖ **Yes** | One side must use `mappedBy` |
| `@ManyToMany` | Either side | ‚úÖ **Yes** | One side must use `mappedBy`, the other defines the `@JoinTable` |

---

### üß† So the rule is:
> üî∏ **Only the inverse side uses `mappedBy`**, and it does **not own** the foreign key.  
> üî∏ **The owning side defines the actual database relationship** ‚Äî like `@JoinColumn`.

---

### ‚úÖ Example: `User ‚Üî Booking`

```java
// Owning side (Many side) - contains @JoinColumn
@Entity
public class Booking {
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "driver_id")  // foreign key column in booking table
    private User driver;
}
```

```java
// Inverse side (One side) - uses mappedBy
@Entity
public class User {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "driver")  // refers to the field 'driver' in Booking
    private List<Booking> drivingBookings;
}
```

---

### ‚ùó If you put `mappedBy` on the wrong side:

- JPA will ignore it (if it's on the owning side),
- or worse, it might throw an error or not map the relationship properly.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

| Relationship      | Owning Side (`@JoinColumn`) | Inverse Side (`mappedBy`) |
|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `OneToMany`/`ManyToOne` | `ManyToOne`                   | `OneToMany(mappedBy)`       |
| `OneToOne`        | One with `@JoinColumn`      | Other with `mappedBy`      |
| `ManyToMany`      | One with `@JoinTable`       | Other with `mappedBy`      |
